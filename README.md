### Browser support

The client-side SDK is supported by all modern browsers that support the standardized WebSocket and Promise APIs. 
These browsers together represent more than 95% of global usage.

## Installation

There are two ways to install the Croct SDK: 

### NPM

The recommended way to install the SDK is via [NPM](https://npmjs.com). It pairs nicely with module bundlers such as 
Webpack or Browserify and includes Typescript typings.

In most cases, it should be as simple as running the following in your project:

```sh
npm install @croct/plug
```

### Script Tag

To install the SDK as a script tag, add the following line to the `<head>` tag of your site on any pages you plan 
to use the SDK to personalize or track events. Next, replace the `<APP_ID>` placeholder with the respective 
application's public ID.

```html
 <script src="https://cdn.croct.io/js/v1/lib/plug.js?appId=<APP_ID>"></script>
```

## Documentation

This reference documents all methods available in our client-side JavaScript SDK, and explains in detail how 
these methods work.
