# Events

Events tell the story of what happened during a user's journey. Besides helping understand how a user interacts 
with your application, these events also provide data to enrich the evaluation context and refine the models that 
continuously improve user experience.

The SDK tracks most of the general-purpose events automatically for you. All other events depend on your use case, so 
it is up to you to decide which events make sense for your application.

## Summary

There are several event types that you can record within the customer journey:

## Events

### User Events

The User category has the following events:

#### userSignedUp

This event records that a user has signed up.

You should track this event when a user signs up for your application.

If the user profile does not exist, the engine will create a new one with the provided information. 
This event does not affect existing profiles.

For the personalization engine, the semantics of this event does not encompass the 
[`userSignedIn`](#usersignedin) event. If your application automatically signs in users after registration, make sure 
to call the [`identify`](plug.md#identify) method after the sign-up.

##### Properties

This event supports the following properties:
