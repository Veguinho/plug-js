# Events

Events tell the story of what happened during a user's journey. Besides helping understand how a user interacts 
with your application, these events also provide data to enrich the evaluation context and refine the models that 
continuously improve user experience.

The SDK tracks most of the general-purpose events automatically for you. All other events depend on your use case, so 
it is up to you to decide which events make sense for your application.

## Summary

There are several event types that you can record within the customer journey:

| Event                      | Category      | Auto tracking | Description                           |

## User Events

The user category has the following events:

### userSignedUp

This event records that a user has signed up.

You should track this event when a user signs up for your application.

If the user profile does not exist, the engine will create a new one with the provided information. 
This event does not affect existing profiles.

For the personalization engine, the semantics of this event does not encompass the 
[`userSignedIn`](#usersignedin) event. If your application automatically signs in users after registration, make sure 
to call the [`identify`](plug.md#identify) method after the sign-up.

**Note:**

- The `sku` and `productId` do not have to be different. Usually, the `product` is the internal identifier, like `12345,` and the SKU is a public-facing identifier like `SM-124-GREEN`.
- The `displayPrice` is the price the user pays, while the `originalPrice` is usually the regular retail price.

## Analytics Events

The analytics category has the following events:

### goalCompleted

This event records a completed activity, called a conversion.

You should track this event when a user completes a desired goal, such as filling out a form or downloading a resource.

#### Properties

This event supports the following properties:

| Property   | Type     | Required | Constraints      | Description
|------------|----------|----------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| `goalId`   | `string` | Yes      | 1 to 50 chars    | The ID of the goal
| `currency` | `string` | No       | 1 to 10 chars    | The currency in which the monetary value is expressed. The currency should be specified using the 3-letter currency codes defined by the ISO 4217 standard. For currencies having no official recognition in ISO 4217, as is the case with cryptocurrencies, it is allowed the use of non-ISO codes adopted locally or commercially.
| `value`    | `number` | No       | Non-negative     | The monetary value associated to the completion of the goal. This can represent an estimated value or a symbolic value. For example, if the sales team can close 10% of people who sign up for a newsletter, and the average transaction is $500, then a possible value for newsletter sign-ups can be $50 (i.e., 10% of $500).

#### Code Sample

Here are two examples of how to track this event:
