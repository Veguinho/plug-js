# Troubleshooting

Sometimes things go wrong. This guide is aimed at making them right. It has two sections:

Troubleshooting your application - Useful for users who are deploying code into Kubernetes and wondering why it is not working.
Troubleshooting your cluster - Useful for cluster administrators and people whose Kubernetes cluster is unhappy.
You should also check the known issues for the release you're using.
